# ML Image Classification and Identity Detection at the Network Edge
> This is a ***___WORK-IN-PROGRESS___** (WIP) and will consist of many updates and because my knowledge of ML and TensorFlow is limited may at times contain inaccurate/oversimplified versions of very complex topics. 


This is my first project using ML and TensorFlow. I want to undertake this project to be able to find out who someone is based on an image. I also want this to be able to work on a device that may not have the processing power to compute this type of workflow.
